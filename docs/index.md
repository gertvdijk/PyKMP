This module is developed for reading out Kamstrup meters using their vendor-specific KMP
protocol.

Tested with a MULTICALÂ® 403, based on documentation of the protocol for the older
MULTICALÂ® models.

Current state: *alpha* â€“ based on the documentation it "should work" with a MULTICALÂ®
30x/40x/60x, but for other models: YMMV.
*Pull requests welcome!*

!!! warning "Warning: battery consumption impact"

    Please be informed about the battery consumption impact, read the [battery consumption page](battery-consumption.md).

    Use at your own risk.

## Features âœ¨

*Note that this is a **library**, intended primarily for development or integration.*

- [x] A **bundled CLI tool** to interact with the meter for testing/development purposes
    with JSON format output (optional).
- [x] Read **multiple registers in one go** to conserve the meter's internal battery as
    much as possible.
- [x] Having it all **fully type-annotated** (mypy strict, zero `type: ignore`s) should
    make using this library a breeze.
- [x] **100% test coverage** (library, not the tool yet).
- [x] Ability to decode the base-10 variable length floating point values in registers
    **without loss of significance**.
- [x] **CRC checksum** verification (and adding).
- [x] Agnostic to the direction for message encoding, ie. you could go wild and
    **emulate a meter** using your IR optical head. ðŸ¤“
