For most situation you would want to use the optical/infrared interface.
For that, you will need an IR optical read-out head with serial (or serial-to-USB)
interface.

Using
[Ali-Express: 'USB to optical interface IrDA near-infrared magnetic adapter'][ali-e-link-optical-head]
this is confirmed working with the MULTICALÂ® 403 (IR head positioned upside down).

Note that a magnet is required to enable the IR circuit, but it's not strong enough to
maintain the position of the head on its own.
You would still want to find a way to mount the head for a permanent installation.
