This project's existence is mainly thanks to all the information and regarding the KMP
protocol people have put online over the years.

The MeterLogger project have left [some notes][meterlogger-wiki-kmp]for the development
of the MeterLogger for Kamstrup meters.
Also the work by Poul-Henning Kamp (and later Ronald van der Meer) in
[GitHub: `ronaldvdmeer/multical402-4-domoticz`][github-ronaldvdmeer-multical402] was
inspiring to get started with exploring possibilities and testing my hardware.

Finally, also a shoutout to the Dutch community Tweakers where a forum topic pointed out
the possibilities integrating these MULTICAL¬Æ meters (as provided by Dutch utilities) to
non-cloud smart home.
