Technical description of meters sometimes show a little information of the design and
generic specification of the protocol.
This gives some clues about device-specific registers or a graphical explanation of the
OSI layers.
However, important details are in a separate document which is seemingly only available
under NDA. ðŸ˜¢

Some more clues can be found in related communcation interfaces like MODBUS where
registers are listed:
[Modbus/KMP TCP/IP module for MULTICALÂ® 603 Data sheet][multical-hu-kmp-modbus-datasheet]

Nice people from the MeterLogger project have left [some notes][meterlogger-wiki-kmp]
for the development of the MeterLogger for Kamstrup meters.

Access to the vendor's own software to communicate with the meters ('Metertool HCW') is
not available (or at least not for free).
